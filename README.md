## 📌 Overview

**Museum Of Candy** is a static web project showcasing a fun, responsive UI built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Bootstrap**.  
It’s designed to practice layout, responsiveness, navigation, and modern UI development fundamentals.

This project demonstrates:

- Clean, semantic HTML structure
- Responsive design with Bootstrap grid/utilities
- Custom visuals and styling for a candy-themed experience
- Navigation and content sections styled without JavaScript

## 🧠 Motivation

I built this project to:

1. Reinforce core front-end fundamentals.
2. Master Bootstrap’s utility classes and responsive layout.
3. Practice real-world webpage design patterns (header, hero, cards, grid, footer).

This isn’t just a template — it reflects deliberate UI choices and an eye toward design clarity.
